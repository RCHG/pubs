+- edit bibtex on add
- option to add tag on add
- paths in metadata must be relative
- include package data in setup.py (see setup.py for more info)
- in the script papers, why do we use a dictionary and not a list? it may be confusing, the key is not the subparser name. The subparser name is defined in the cmd files
