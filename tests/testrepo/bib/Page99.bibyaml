        abstract: The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter,
            which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there
            is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance
            of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages
            objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest
            and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random
            Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers
            of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.
