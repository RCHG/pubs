        abstract: <p>The advent of humanoid robots has enabled a new approach to investigating
            the acquisition of language, and we report on the development of robots
            able to acquire rudimentary linguistic skills. Our work focuses on early
            stages analogous to some characteristics of a human child of about 6 to
            14 months, the transition from babbling to first word forms. We investigate
            one mechanism among many that may contribute to this process, a key factor
            being the sensitivity of learners to the statistical distribution of linguistic
            elements. As well as being necessary for learning word meanings, the acquisition
            of anchor word forms facilitates the segmentation of an acoustic stream
            through other mechanisms. In our experiments some salient one-syllable
            word forms are learnt by a humanoid robot in real-time interactions with
            naive participants. Words emerge from random syllabic babble through a
            learning process based on a dialogue between the robot and the human participant,
            whose speech is perceived by the robot as a stream of phonemes. Numerous
            ways of representing the speech as syllabic segments are possible. Furthermore,
            the pronunciation of many words in spontaneous speech is variable. However,
            in line with research elsewhere, we observe that salient content words
            are more likely than function words to have consistent canonical representations;
            thus their relative frequency increases, as does their influence on the
            learner. Variable pronunciation may contribute to early word form acquisition.
            The importance of contingent interaction in real-time between teacher
            and learner is reflected by a reinforcement process, with variable success.
            The examination of individual cases may be more informative than group
            results. Nevertheless, word forms are usually produced by the robot after
            a few minutes of dialogue, employing a simple, real-time, frequency dependent
            mechanism. This work shows the potential of human-robot interaction systems
            in studies of the dynamics of early language acquisition.</p>
